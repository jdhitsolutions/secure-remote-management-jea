# Secure Remote Management with Just Enough Administration

Source material and demonstration files for a session presented at Techmentor/Live360 in Orlando, FL November 2019.

## Description

Remotely managing your data center whether on-premises or in the cloud with PowerShell is very easy. if you have administrator privileges.
But there are plenty of scenarios where you'd like to provide remote access but don't want to provide full admin access.
That's where __Just Enough Administration__ or JEA comes into play.
With JEA you can safely provide access to non-admins and limit what commands
they can run.
You can even limit what parameters they use and what values can be accepted. In other words, just enough administration to get the job done.
This session is intended to introduce JEA concepts and tools and demonstrate how you can get started today.
